## Introducing the sequence graph

In the assembly lecture the concept of a sequence graph was introduced. It is possible to view this graph using the tool Bandage [https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/](https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/). You can download the file in the link, unzip it, and follow the installation instructions. 

### Examining the file containing the sequence graph

View the sequence graph using less:

~~~
$ cd ~/assembly/barcode02/
$ ls
$ less -S assembly_graph.gfa
H       VN:Z:1.0
S       edge_1  CGCTATCGAAGCGTATGTTTCTATTGCCGCTACGCCGATCACTGACGCTTGCGCACTGAAAGCCGTGACCATGATTGCCGAAAACCTGCCGTTAGCCGTTGAAGATGGCAGTAATGCGAAAGCGCGTGAAGCAATGGCTTA>

P       contig_3        edge_3+ *
P       contig_4        edge_4+ *

~~~
{: .bash}

If your contigs are very long, you may want to cut each line to 50 characters before viewing:

~~~
$ cut -c-50 assembly_graph.gfa |less
~~~
{: .bash}

Can you understand how the sequence graph works? Look at the text. In the example all 4 contigs are only connected to themselves. What does that mean?

###  Visualizing the sequence graph

Download a the sequence graph from your assembly. Open it in Bandage. Click on Draw graph. What does this remind you of?
Click on a few contigs. What is the average sequencing depth? 

### Selecting a smaller circular contig

Now, we will select a contig which is small and circular (if present). Find a contig which is between 5 and 100 kb. 

### Investigating a contig with high depth using Bandage and BLAST

Click on this contig. What do you think this contig is?  In the "Output" menu, at the top, the sequence of the selected contig can be copied to the clipboard. Figure out what the contig codes for using BLASTN [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome).  Also record the contig number. Can you calculate the number of copies of this contig compared to the rest of the genome?

### Where are these sequences located?

Although the sequence is a separate contig in the fasta file, we can figure out to which contigs it is connected if it is not a circular contig. We could for instance investigate the sequence graph in a text editor. Alternatively, we select scope "Around nodes" and fill in the number of our selected contig. Next, we fill in 4 for the distance and press Draw Graph. What do you think this does? Try to figure out where the contig of interest is connected to. What can you do with this kind of information?
